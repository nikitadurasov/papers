## General comments on paper (8/10):

* really great introduction into Bayesian ideas for deep learning
* easy to read and kinda understandable weithout prior experience

## Comments:

* I like this connection between full posterior computation and max
likelyhood training techniques: second could be considered as approximation
of integral in first, but instead of full integration we're trying too
find argmax of weights posterior and use it to approximate this integral

* cool explanation of hyperparameters learning via hierarchical models
(+ explanation what hierarchical models are)

* pretty understandable introduction to MCMC methods and bayesian models
evaluation
